# Digit recognition
## Competition description
In this competition, your goal is to correctly identify digits from a dataset of tens of thousands of handwritten images. Weâ€™ve curated a set of tutorial-style kernels which cover everything from regression to neural networks. We encourage you to experiment with different algorithms to learn first-hand what works well and how techniques compare.

My place on a public Leaderboard is 659 and  0.99475 accuracy
