The pictures are divided into five classes: chamomile, tulip, rose, sunflower, dandelion. For each class there are about 800 photos. Photos are not high resolution, about 320x240 pixels. Photos are not reduced to a single size, they have different proportions!
The data collection is based on scraped data from flickr, google images, and yandex images
